## Hi 👋. I'm
# Adrián Melián

I am dedicated to multiplatform software development, specializing in web environments with Angular, Javascript, Python and C#.
As a personal project, I am developing a 2D videogame for the classic Sega Saturn system, a great challenge that I hope to complete.
My profession has become a passion, being this what has led me to evolve, working with national and international clients, or facing new programming languages.
